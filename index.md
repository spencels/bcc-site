After a five-year hiatus the Boulder Couch Crash is back, so pack your Chacos, some plaid, and a bottle of sunscreen and visit <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/colorado/happiest-city-united-states-boulder-colorado-2017/"> the happiest city in the US! </a>

### What is a couch crash?

A couch crash is a weekend filled with activities organized by a local Couchsurfing community. The activities show off the local city to the global CS community. A couch crash is an excellent way to get to know a city and connect with amazing Couchsurfers.

### What does the Boulder Couch Crash have to offer? {#schedule}

We will bike on some of Boulder’s 300+ miles of dedicated bikeways, hike on some of the 150+ miles of trails, and drink beer at some of Boulder’s 20+ breweries. And did we mention blue skies, creek tubing and legal marijuana?

### How do I get to Boulder? {#getting-to-boulder}

Depending on where you’re coming from, you can walk, run, bike, hitchhike, drive, or fly. But seriously, book your flight to Denver International Airport and then catch the bus to Boulder. The AB bus is the cheapest and simplest way to get from the airport to Boulder; it runs approximately every hour but you can check the full schedule <a href="http://www3.rtd-denver.com/schedules/getSchedule.action?runboardId=2514&routeId=AB&routeType=9&&direction=W-Bound&serviceType=3#direction"> here </a>.

When catching the bus from the airport, head to the DEN Transit Center — go to the south end of the Jeppesen Terminal, exit through the glass doors, and take the escalator to the ground level. It’s located next to the Westin.

Look for the AB/AB1/AB2 bus to Boulder. One-way fare is $9 and you must have exact change. The bus will take about an hour. If you get off at the last stop, you’ll be here:

### How do I get around Boulder?

Our little town is incredibly bike- and pedestrian-friendly!

<div class="text">
  <h4>Bike</h4>
  <p>We have over 300 miles of dedicated bikeways to get you where you need to go, making a bicycle the preferred transportation method of Boulderites no matter what the weather. You can rent bikes from places like University Cycle or Full Cycle starting at $20 per day. If you want something cheaper, Boulder BCycle has 43 stations and 300 bikes in town with various fee structures.</p>
  <p>We’re also working on a local “bike library” for the couch crash, so check back for details.</p>

  <h4>Bus</h4>
  <p>We have about 12 local bus routes that run through town. A local single day pass costs $5.20. The bus is convenient and frequently used by locals. Check the RTD website for schedules and routes, or use Google Maps for equally accurate information, including real-time bus locations.</p>

  <h4>Ride shares</h4>
  <p>Uber and Lyft rides are readily available in Boulder. Check both apps if you want the cheapest price. Most rides within Boulder will be $12 or less.</p>

<div class="text">
  <h4>Car</h4>
  <p>Depending on afternoon traffic, driving could take longer than biking. Plus, if you want to park near downtown, you’ll have to pay for a garage or feed the meter every two hours. Driving is not encouraged, especially if you want to enjoy 7.5% IPAs or legal marijuana. That said, if you plan to visit anywhere outside of Boulder aside from Denver, the most convenient way to get there is by car.</p>
